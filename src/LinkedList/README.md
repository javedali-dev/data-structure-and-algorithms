Many of us are familiar with array as a data structure. Array is an amazing data structure because:
1. It supports random access to the element. means you can access any element in the array with constant time `O(1)`.
2. Easy to implement and easy to learn.
3. Array store element with reference to indexes that make it more flexible to work with.

With all this advantage there is one thing that array is not capable of is dynamic in size. 
> Arrays are fixed in size.  

Although you can make dynamic array like double the size when array is overflow. But it is not come out of box especially in the low level languages. Some high level language does implement dynamic array like Java provide `ArrayList` API and python has `list` API.
